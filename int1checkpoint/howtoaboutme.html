    <h1 id="t4"> How I Chose My Code</h1>
    <div id="explanation">
    <p> When I was chosing how I wanted to design my page, I decided to go with everyting in  a box. So, if you look at my page every topic or code I explained is in a box. I also wanted my box to have a border so I added that. At first I wanted to put 2 boxes per line but the images would be to small or too blurry to read so I changed it to one box per row. On the About Me page I decided to list out what I learned and make it an unordered list. On my How To-About Me, since some boxes couldn't fit on the 2 boxes per row line I decided to just have one box per row and would center it. I moved the margin to the left and changed the width of the background color and border so it could all align and look good. When chosing my colors I tired to chose a variety of colors and not repeating a color more than once. When chosing what would go in the boxes, orginally, I was just going to have my information in one box and then the picture outside but, when I started coding, I liked having the pictures in the box.<//p>
