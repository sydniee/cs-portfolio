            <h3 id="sport"> What is My Favorite Sport?</h3>
            <p id="p2"> My favorite sport is volleyball. I have been playing volleyball for 5 years. I've played club volleyball for 4 years and gone to the Girls Junior National Championships 3 times. To go to Junior Nationals you have to earn a bid. To earn a bid,
                you have to be one of the top teams in your region or win a national qualifier.</p>

            <h3 id="travel"> Where is an Interesting Place I've Traveled?</h3>
            <p> One place in the world that i've traveled to is Caye Caulker, Belize. It is a very small island that is 5 miles long and 1 mile wide. When I was 11 I traveled to Belize with my family. I went snorkeling while in Belize and that was the highlight
                of my trip. I swam with sharks, stingrays, and fish. I also saw a sea tutrtle, manatee and a sunken ship while snorkelig. It was a blast</p>
